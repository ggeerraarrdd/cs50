# CS50

An archive of work for CS50x, CS50P and CS50SQL

_CS50_ is an archive of final projects submitted for several variants of [CS50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CS50).

Taking to heart the CS50 team's call to `Strive to create something that outlives th[e] course`, these v1.0.0 versions have undergone continuous improvements and feature additions since their submission.

Per CS50's [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/honesty/) policy, solutions to Problem Sets (psets) are not archived in this repository. However, they can be shared upon requests by non-"future students", such as recruiters and hiring managers.

For portfolio purposes, pset8 of CS50x: `Homepage` is an exception. Check it out on its own repo at [Large Parks](https://github.com/ggeerraarrdd/large-parks).

These projects are shared in the spirit of self-learning, and hope they become valuable resources in your own educational journey.
